# Taxonomic_Vote
The taxonomic vote procedure is based on the results obtained by BLAST+, although it can be easily applied to other programs yielding scored results of similarity searches against predefined databases. Implementing this analysis will allow to keep the most probable taxonomy for each gene and to understand how many genes of a sample are well identified or not. Also, it gives information about the taxonomy of the sample for each taxonomic level, contributing to create a very approximate idea of the closest relative organism to that in the sample of interest.
